# esp8266 DSMR2MQTT

Software for the ESP2866 that sends P1 smart meter data to an MQTT broker (with OTA firmware updates)

This project is a simplified version of [Flip Hess' project](https://github.com/fliphess/esp8266_p1meter)


## Connection of the P1 meter to the ESP8266

| ESP8266 Pin | P1 Pin |
| ----        | ----   |
| GND         | GND    |
| 3V3         | RTS    |
| DATA (RXD)  | D5     |

Use a 10K resistor in between between DATA (RXD) and RTS.

## Data Sent

All metrics are send to their own MQTT topic.
The ESP8266 sends out to the following MQTT topics:

```
sensors/power/p1meter/consumption_low_tarif 2209397
sensors/power/p1meter/consumption_high_tarif 1964962
sensors/power/p1meter/actual_consumption 313
sensors/power/p1meter/instant_power_usage 313
sensors/power/p1meter/instant_power_current 1000
sensors/power/p1meter/gas_meter_m3 968922
sensors/power/p1meter/actual_tarif_group 2
sensors/power/p1meter/short_power_outages 3
sensors/power/p1meter/long_power_outages 1
sensors/power/p1meter/short_power_drops 0
sensors/power/p1meter/short_power_peaks 0
```

## Home Assistant Configuration

Following is an example definition of the sensors on your config.yaml

```
- platform: mqtt
  name: P1 Consumption Low Tarif
  unit_of_measurement: 'kWh'
  state_topic: "sensors/power/p1meter/consumption_low_tarif"
  value_template: "{{ value|float / 1000 }}"

- platform: mqtt
  name: P1 Consumption High Tarif
  unit_of_measurement: 'kWh'
  state_topic: "sensors/power/p1meter/consumption_high_tarif"
  value_template: "{{ value|float / 1000 }}"

- platform: mqtt
  name: P1 Actual Power Consumption
  unit_of_measurement: 'kW'
  state_topic: "sensors/power/p1meter/actual_consumption"
  value_template: "{{ value|float / 1000 }}"

- platform: mqtt
  name: P1 Instant Power Usage
  unit_of_measurement: 'kW'
  state_topic: "sensors/power/p1meter/instant_power_usage"
  value_template: "{{ value|float / 1000 }}"

- platform: mqtt
  name: P1 Instant Power Current
  unit_of_measurement: 'A'
  state_topic: "sensors/power/p1meter/instant_power_current"
